<i>Advisor: <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dpanagou/", style="color:#0000FF;">Prof. Dimitra Panagou </a>, University of Michigan &emsp; (Sep 2017 - till date)</i><br><br>
As part of my Ph.D research, I have been developing control algorithms for a team of defending robots that are protecting a safety-critical area from attacks by adversarial robots. I have been studying herding and interception strategies for the defending team for class of attacking behaviors by the adversarial team. The developed algorithms lie at the intersection of game theory (non-zero sum games), optimal control, finite-time stability, combinatorial optimization and machine learning techniques. <br>

<font size="3"><b>1) 'StringNet Herding' approach to herd an adversarial swarm</b></font><br>
<div class="ProjectContent">
<ul>
<li> 'StringNet' is a closed formation of barriers formed by the defenders around the adversarial swarm in order to constraint the and control the attackers' motion.
</li>
<li> A combination of open-loop, near time-optimal controllers (that
result in forming the defenders’ formation), and statefeedback controllers with finite-time convergence guarantees under bounded inputs (that guide the formation
around attackers and towards the safe area) synthesize
the herding strategy.
</li>
</ul>

<li> We develop a clustering-based assignment algorithm to herd swarms of attackers in the event when all attackers do not stay together but rather split into smaller sub-swarms as they sense the defenders.
</li>
<li> We use ‘Density-based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN)’ algorithm to identify the spatially distributed swarms of the attackers and the defenders are then assigned to each identified swarm of attackers by solving a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP).

<ul>
<li>Implemented a motion planning algorithm which generalizes the Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) framework to Feedback controller based
Information-state RoadMap (FIRM) that takes into account motion and sensing uncertainty in planning.
<li> The FIRM is a roadmap constructed in belief space, where its nodes are small subsets of belief space and the edges of
FIRM are Markov chains in belief space induced by feedback controllers.
<li> Constructed FIRM by first sampling PRM nodes and associating FIRM nodes to these PRM nodes and used Linear
quadratic Gaussian (LQG = LQR + Kalman filter) controller to stabilize the quadrotor from one node to another.
<li> Created a dense roadmap so that the stabilizing controllers can be directly used as edge controllers and
assigned a cost to each of these edges which is calculated based on the estimation error during belief propagation
and the stabilization time.
<li> Calculated transition probabilities using a particle based approach and simulated optimal control policy search by solving 
dynamic programming.
